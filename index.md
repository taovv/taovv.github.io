[//]: # (## About Me)

I am a three-year M.S. student at the College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University (SZU),
supervised by Prof. [Zhihui Lai](https://www.scholat.com/laizhihui). Previously, I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science from
Guilin University of Electronic Technology (GUET) in 2020.

My research interests are in Computer Vision, including but
not limited to:
- _Medical Image Segmentation_
- _Semantic Segmentation_
- _Semi-supervised Learning_
- _Self-supervised Learning_

## Research Experience

<b>Diagnosis and classification of multimodal breast tumors</b><br>
<b>NSFC</b>, <em>Sep 2020 ~ now</em><br>
Responsible for medical image segmentation algorithms in the project:
- We collected and made two breast tumor ultrasound image data sets with segmentation annotations, and designed an 
ultrasound image segmentation model based on the two datasets. This work is in progress.
- A feature fusion network based on transformer is studied. This method aims to solve the problem of discontinuity of 
lesion area in ultrasound images under supervision. This work is published in ACPR 2021 as oral presentation.
- We study a medical image segmentation algorithm based on pixel contrastive learning in semi-supervised environment. 
This method uses uncertainty to guide pixels with high confidence for contrastive learning, so as to make efficient 
use of unmarked data to improve the performance of the model. This work was published in IJCAI-ECAI 2022.
